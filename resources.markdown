There are some fantastic resources out there to learn how to use static websites for a variety of purposes beyond digital research. The most important resource to consult is the [Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/) by Tom Preston-Werner and Jekyll contributors.

## Tutorials

There are also some useful tutorials with a focus on digital research. [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/) has one workshop on how to create a static website with Jekyll and GitHub pages, which most of this site's documentation is derived from:

* [Building a static website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages#github--github-pages-)
