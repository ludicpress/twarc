Welcome to my website for how to create a static website with Jekyll and GitHub pages in digital research! You will notice there are several sections to the website, including:

* The [About](https://ludicpress.github.io/staticsites/about/) page explains what are static websites is and why you can use them for digital research;  
* The [Resources](https://ludicpress.github.io/staticsites/resources/) page provides some additional tutorial documentation for Jekyll and GitHub;  
* The [Setup](https://ludicpress.github.io/staticsites/setup/) page covers installation guidelines for Linux, Windows, and OS X users; and  
* The [Workshop](https://ludicpress.github.io/staticsites/workshop/) page outlines how to create your static website once you've setup Ruby on machine.

Each time there is a significant update to the content on this website I will create a blog post outlining the changes. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.
